# Dessert App

### Runing the app
- The app should run very simply. After clicking run in xcode, the app should start with the TableView. After a brief moment of loading, the TableView should populate with dessert recipes.

- From there, any one of the recipes are clickable and will take you to a second page that is a scroll view in order to view the details of the recipe.
